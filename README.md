# hello-world
My first repository

Pardinn here. This is my first time ever on Git. I'm just trying to learn how this works, because I'll probably need it in a near future for my work, so I'm checking this out. I'm also considering using this for my personal projects and that's why I'm checking this. 

I'm familiar with VBScript and VBA for Excel and also know a little bit of Java. I work with automation so I really want to level up my programming skills
